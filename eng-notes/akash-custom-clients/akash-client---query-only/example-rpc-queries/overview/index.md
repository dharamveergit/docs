Two example queries are included for illustration.  Using these examples queries as a template we can conduct similar read operations on any Akash blockchain as element.

* [Query All Deployments on the Blockchain](/docs/eng-notes/akash-custom-clients/akash-client---query-only/example-rpc-queries/query-all-deployments-on-the-blockchain/)
* [Query a Specific Deployment ID (DSEQ and Owner ID Specified)](/docs/eng-notes/akash-custom-clients/akash-client---query-only/example-rpc-queries/query-a-specific-deployment-id/)
* [Using Examples to Build Your Own Query](/docs/eng-notes/akash-custom-clients/akash-client---query-only/example-rpc-queries/using-examples-to-build-your-own-query/)
